## Type of Challenge: 	
* Dealing with huge amount of real Data from Production.
* Analysing, cleaning and pre-processing all data files.
* Visualizing data.
* Modelling data using Supervised Machine Learning techniques.
* Predicting width constriction and visualizing it.

## Dataset details:
* Main_CoilFile.csv with attributs:
    (coil,	furnace Number,	analyse,	Hardness_1,	Hardness_2,	Width,	Temperature before finishing mill,	Temperature after finishing mill,	Thickness,	Thickness profile,	c,	mn,	si,	nb,	p,	s,	al,	ma,	b,	n,	ti,	cr,	va,	mo)


* More the 57,000 CSV files of each Coil-file with attributs(Coil Number, Coil Stage, Lengthpoints and Values)

## Description:
ArcelorMittal  is a project where we predicted width constrictions by given data from our Client.Here is our staps

* First of all We analyzed, cleaned and pre-processed all raw data.
* Next we visualised, recognized  and calculated the constriction for each coil 
* After that we seperated all the coils which has width constriction within (4-5mm) and merged it in Main_CoilFile.
* With this calculated width constriction values we created various models using other given attributes like        
  tempareture, average width, thickness and differents chemical components.
